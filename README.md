# postfixCalc
Infix to postfix and calculated
I tried making two codes, one for conversion from infix to postfix. which was a pain. I first started to think i need two stacks but not until the very end did i realize i needed only one stack with a very fine filter to make the elements in their proper places but didn't have time to finish it. Then i tried to create the calculation code but realized that i need to figure out what my output is goning to be from the conversion first so then continued to work on the conversion code.
